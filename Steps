# 2  Date Table Creation
Created a dedicated Date table to support time intelligence and trend analysis.

```DAX
Date table =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR (DATE(2019,1,1), DATE(2021,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "Month Number", MONTH([Date])
)
---Marked the table as a Date Table and linked it to the fact table.
# 3 Time Helper Columns
--To enable proper monthly analysis and sorting:
-DAX

Month Year =
FORMAT('Date table'[Date], "MMM yyyy")

Month Year Sort =
'Date table'[Year] * 100 + 'Date table'[Month Number]

--The Month Year column is sorted using Month Year Sort to maintain chronological order.

# 4 DAX Measures
--Core business measures created using DAX:

Total Sales =
SUM(retail_sales[Sales])

Total Profit =
SUM(retail_sales[Profit])

Total Customers =
DISTINCTCOUNT(retail_sales[Customer ID])

Profit Margin % =
DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)

YoY Sales Growth % =
VAR PreviousYearSales =
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Sales],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date table'[Date])
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales] - PreviousYearSales,
    PreviousYearSales,
    0
)
